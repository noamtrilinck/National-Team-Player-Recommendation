# Local flag asset sources

**Ported as-is from the "Agent's Player to Club Model" project** (its `dashboard/assets/flags/`,
Sprint 7.8-7.9), which is the reference implementation for this flag system — see that project's
`docs/stage7_sprint7_9_unified_flag_system_lock.md` for the full development history. Verified
directly (not assumed) before porting: this project's own 150 production `nationality` values are
an exact match for the reference implementation's 150-value universe (the only difference is that
the reference project's data separately used "Türkiye" as an alias in one upstream join -- this
project's data only ever uses "Turkey", so that alias key is present but unused here). Nothing in
this file was re-sourced or re-verified independently; the licensing/attribution below is carried
over unchanged from the reference implementation.

150 nationality/country values (151 dict keys — "Turkey" and "Türkiye" are two spellings for the
same flag, see `nationality_flags.py`), all resolved to a local SVG file. No external runtime
dependency, no API call, no subscription — every file is committed to this repo and read from
local disk. Two sources, chosen for different reasons:

## 144 ordinary countries — flag-icons (MIT license)

`dashboard/assets/flags/countries/<iso2>.svg` — 144 files, one per ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code used in
`NATIONALITY_REPRESENTATION`.

**Source**: [github.com/lipis/flag-icons](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icons) (the `flags/4x3/`
variant — every flag normalized to the same 640×480 viewBox for source-level consistency).
**License**: MIT (verified directly against the repository's own `LICENSE` file, reproduced
below). **Why this source**: a single, purpose-built, internally-consistent SVG set, rather than
144 individually-collected files of varying native style/quality — the explicit "prefer a
consistent flag set" requirement.

## 6 hand-sourced exceptions — Wikimedia Commons (Public Domain)

Unchanged from Sprint 7.8 — a standard ISO-3166-1-keyed set cannot represent these correctly at
all (no code exists for three of them; the other three would be visually wrong or platform-
unreliable if drawn from a generic set). Each individually verified and justified — see
`nationality_flags.py`'s module docstring for the full per-case reasoning.

## Northern Ireland — decision note (do not relabel this file)

This SVG is the historical governmental flag of Northern Ireland (1953-1972, commonly called the
"Ulster Banner"), **not** Northern Ireland's current official flag — Northern Ireland has had no
official governmental flag since its Parliament was abolished in 1973 (confirmed directly,
Wikipedia: "Ulster Banner"). It is used here **specifically and only because FIFA itself uses this
flag to represent the Northern Ireland national football team internationally** (confirmed
directly, Wikipedia: "The Ulster Banner is used to represent Northern Ireland at the Commonwealth
Games, by FIFA to represent the Northern Ireland national football team..."). Given this
application's nationality field is football nationality, not sovereign citizenship, this is the
correct convention to follow here — see `nationality_flags.py`'s docstring for the full reasoning.
The local filename (`northern_ireland_football.svg`, not `northern_ireland.svg`) is deliberately
scoped to make this football-specific usage unambiguous, not a claim about Northern Ireland's
official state flag. **flag-icons does provide a generic `gb-nir.svg`, but it was deliberately NOT
used** — it is not the football-specific representation this application already validated and
committed to in Sprint 7.8.

## Verification

All 150 files were downloaded directly from the sources above, inspected before use (each is a
small, self-contained, valid SVG with no external references, redirects, or broken links), and are
committed to this repo exactly as downloaded, unmodified. Total footprint: ~1.2MB across 150 files.
